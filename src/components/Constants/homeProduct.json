      "description": "Experience unparalleled efficiency with our Servo Driven Paper Cup Machine, a marvel of engineering that integrates advanced mechanical, electronic, pneumatic, and electrical technologies. This high-precision machine is equipped with 13 servos that work in perfect sync via PLC, enabling the production of up to 180 high-quality paper cups per minute, equivalent to 3 cups per second. The machine features a two-step curling process, which ensures the rim of each cup is curled twice to provide extra rigidity and durability & High-quality sealing is guaranteed through the use of ultrasonic and hot air mechanisms, minimizing the risk of leakage, making it ideal for both hot and cold beverages.",
